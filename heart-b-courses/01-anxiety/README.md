HEART-B Course Content — Anxiety
SECTION 1 — SYMPTOMS

(Educational · Trauma-informed · Non-diagnostic)

Anxiety often develops quietly and gradually. It rarely begins as panic. More often, it starts as a constant sense of alertness — a feeling that something is wrong even when nothing obvious is happening.

Common emotional symptoms include:

persistent worry that feels difficult to shut off

fear without a clear cause

irritability or emotional sensitivity

feelings of helplessness or loss of control

Cognitive symptoms may involve:

racing or looping thoughts

difficulty concentrating or making decisions

mental fatigue from constant overthinking

expecting negative outcomes automatically

Behavioral symptoms often show up as:

avoidance of situations that feel overwhelming

over-preparing or excessive reassurance-seeking

restlessness or inability to relax

withdrawing from social or professional responsibilities

Physical symptoms can include:

tightness in the chest or throat

stomach discomfort or nausea

headaches or muscle tension

disrupted sleep or chronic exhaustion

Over time, these symptoms tend to escalate rather than stabilize. What once felt manageable can begin to affect relationships, work performance, physical health, and emotional resilience. Many people notice that anxiety spreads — from specific situations into daily life — until it becomes a constant background state.

Anxiety is not a character flaw.
It is often the nervous system working overtime to protect against perceived threat.

SECTION 2 — TRIGGERS

(Pattern recognition · Nervous-system focused)

Triggers are experiences — internal or external — that activate the body’s threat response. For anxiety, triggers do not always look dramatic. Many are subtle and cumulative.

External triggers may include:

conflict or perceived criticism

unpredictable environments

financial pressure or instability

time pressure or excessive responsibility

reminders of past distressing experiences

Internal triggers often involve:

intrusive thoughts or mental imagery

physical sensations interpreted as danger

self-judgment or fear of failure

memories associated with loss or uncertainty

When a trigger appears, the nervous system responds before conscious thought. The body shifts into alert mode, preparing to react even if no immediate danger exists.

Early warning signs commonly include:

increased muscle tension

shallow breathing

faster thought patterns

urge to escape or regain control

Recognizing triggers early allows space for intervention before anxiety escalates into overwhelm.

SECTION 3 — COPING MECHANISMS

(Non-judgmental · Survival-based)

People living with anxiety often develop coping strategies to function day-to-day. These responses are not failures — they are attempts to survive.

Common coping mechanisms include:

over-planning or controlling outcomes

distraction through work, devices, or busyness

avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations

reassurance-seeking from others

emotional suppression

These strategies can offer short-term relief, helping reduce immediate discomfort. However, they often reinforce anxiety long-term by teaching the nervous system that fear must be avoided or controlled rather than resolved.

Over time, coping alone may lead to:

increased exhaustion

narrowing of life choices

dependence on avoidance

frustration when anxiety returns stronger

Understanding coping patterns is not about removing them immediately — it is about recognizing what they were designed to protect against.

SECTION 4 — THE 3 SPHERES OF HEALING

(Integrated · Non-spiritual in this section)

Anxiety affects the whole person. Sustainable healing often requires attention across multiple spheres.

1) Clinical / Physical
Anxiety impacts sleep, digestion, energy levels, and overall physical regulation. Medical support and physical stabilization can help reduce intensity and restore baseline functioning.

2) Psychological / Emotional
Anxiety influences thought patterns, emotional regulation, and self-perception. Emotional support and therapeutic processing help bring awareness to fear-based patterns and reduce internal conflict.

3) Inner Healing
Anxiety often reflects unresolved internal distress stored beneath conscious awareness. Inner healing focuses on identifying the root cause patterns that keep the nervous system in a heightened state of alert.

These spheres work best together rather than in isolation.

SECTION 6 — WORKBOOK & INTEGRATION

(Reflection · Safety · No pressure)

The workbook is designed to support awareness and gentle integration, not rapid change.

Reflective prompts may include:

What symptoms tend to show up most consistently for me?

When did I first notice anxiety becoming part of my daily life?

Which situations or thoughts most often trigger my anxiety response?

How does my body signal that anxiety is increasing?

What coping strategies have helped me function — and where do they fall short?

Participants are encouraged to:

observe patterns without judgment

track triggers over time

notice how anxiety shifts in different environments

practice grounding awareness rather than control

There is no timeline for completion.
Healing unfolds through understanding, safety, and consistency.
