- **Psalm 46:10** — “Be still, and know that I am God.”

Replacing perfection with **progress** rewires the nervous system from constant alert to calm competence. The spiritual reset comes when we shift from *self-reliance* to *God-reliance.*

## Practical Application (2 Tools)
**Tool 1 — Surrender Breath (4-2-7)**

**Tool 2 — Grace Audit**
- Write three areas where perfection blocks peace.  
- For each, note: *what would 80 % done + peace look like?*  
- End by reading Philippians 1:6 (NLV): “He who began a good work …”
