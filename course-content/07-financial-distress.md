# Mini Course 07 — Financial Distress
**Promise:** Break anxiety cycles around money by aligning biblical stewardship, emotional regulation, and practical recovery skills.

---

## Distress Pattern (Clinical)
- Stress response to debt, loss, or instability; shame around provision.
- Fight/flight responses: over-working, avoidance, or panic spending.
- Body: insomnia, tension headaches, digestive upset.
- Mindset: scarcity, guilt, or worth = income.

---

## Biblical Framework (NLV)
- **Philippians 4:19** — “My God will give you everything you need.”
- **Matthew 6:25–33** — Seek first His kingdom; needs are met.
- **Deuteronomy 8:18** — God gives power to create wealth.
- **Proverbs 21:5** — Steady planning brings abundance.

## Teaching Summary
Financial fear rewires survival instincts.  Clinical recovery begins with regulating the body’s panic before tackling budgets.  Spiritually, provision is relational, not transactional.  God is both Shepherd and Supplier.  
The aim is balanced stewardship — faith + wise planning.  When peace rules the heart, prudence can guide the hands.

## Practical Application
**Tool 1 — “Name the Number” Grounding**
- Write current need on paper.  
- Breathe 4-2-6 × 4 rounds while repeating Phil 4:19.  
- Ask, “What is one small action I can take today?”  

**Tool 2 — Faith Budget Reset**
- List essentials, debts, giving, rest.  
- Pray Matthew 6:33 (NLV): “Seek first …”  
- Choose one act of obedience (save, tithe, ask help).

## Devotional
The Provider hasn’t changed.  Lack is temporary; His care is constant.  Faith builds margin inside before it shows outside.
