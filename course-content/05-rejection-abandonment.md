# Mini Course 05 — Rejection & Abandonment
**Promise:** Heal the fear of being unwanted or unseen by learning how God’s unconditional acceptance rewires your attachment wounds and restores belonging.

---

## Distress Pattern (Clinical)
- Core belief: “I’m not enough,” “People always leave,” “I must earn love.”
- Behavioral cycles: cling → fear → withdraw → isolation → depression.
- Physiological markers: anxiety around connection, hypervigilance for cues of disinterest.
- Root: early relational trauma, inconsistent caregiving, betrayal, or chronic neglect.

---

## Biblical Framework (NLV)
- **Psalm 27:10** — “Even if my father and mother leave me, the Lord will take me in.”
- **Ephesians 1:4–6** — You were chosen, adopted, and accepted in Christ.
- **Hebrews 13:5** — “I will never leave you or forsake you.”
- **John 14:18** — “I will not leave you without help; I will come to you.”

## Teaching Summary (Clinical + Spiritual + Practical)
Rejection and abandonment wounds create deep attachment insecurity. The body learns that love equals danger, leading to overdependence or emotional withdrawal. Clinically, the goal is **secure attachment retraining** — learning that safety can exist within connection.

Spiritually, the gospel reframes attachment: in Christ, you are *fully chosen, fully known, and fully loved.* When people fail you, God does not. You can begin to heal by creating *safe relational moments* (eye contact, honest prayer, or healthy community engagement) that signal to your nervous system: “Love no longer equals loss.”

Healing from abandonment involves **embodied faith** — replacing anxious striving with the steady presence of the Father. Every small act of trust re-educates your nervous system to rest in unconditional acceptance.

## Practical Application (2 Tools)
**Tool 1 — Secure Base Visualization (3–5 minutes)**  
- Sit comfortably. Place one hand over your heart, one on your abdomen.  
- Breathe 4-2-6 × 6 rounds while saying:  
  “God, You have not left me. You have chosen me.” (Ephesians 1:4–6)  
- Picture yourself seated beside Christ — steady, seen, safe.

**Tool 2 — Safe Connection Plan (Daily practice)**  
- Identify 1 safe person and 1 consistent time to check in (call/text).  
- Practice voicing one emotion a day instead of withdrawing.  
- Replace “They’ll leave” with “Even if they do, I remain loved by God.”

---

## Short Devotional (2–3 minutes)
When others walked away, God stayed. You were never invisible to Him. His love predates your rejection. Jesus Himself was “despised and rejected,” yet through His rejection, you were adopted. You are not too much, not forgotten, not forsaken. You are chosen.

---

## Scriptures for Meditation (NLV)
- Psalm 27:10; Hebrews 13:5; John 14:18; Romans 8:38–39; Ephesians 1:4–6.

## Narration Script (Video)
**Hook:**  
If you brace for rejection even from those who care, your nervous system may still be guarding an old wound.

**Teach:**  
Rejection trains your body to expect loss. Faith retrains it to expect presence. God promises: “I will never leave you or forsake you” (Hebrews 13:5, NLV). You are chosen and accepted in Christ (Ephesians 1:4–6). We’ll learn to anchor safety in Him while reconnecting safely with others.

**Practice:**  
Hand on heart, breathe 4-2-6. Say aloud: “God, You have chosen me.” Visualize His steady presence. Reach out to one safe person this week.

**CTA:**  
If this brought peace, the Foundation Course will guide you deeper — emotionally, spiritually, relationally.
