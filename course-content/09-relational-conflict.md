## Biblical Framework

- **James 1:19** — Be quick to listen, slow to speak.
- **Ephesians 4:26** — Be angry but do not sin.

## Teaching Summary
Conflict isn’t failure; it’s feedback.  Clinical healing restores calm-communication skills.  Spiritually, reconciliation mirrors the gospel.  We practice *truth in love* instead of silence or attack.
