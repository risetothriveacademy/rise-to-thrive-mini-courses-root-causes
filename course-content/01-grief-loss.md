# Mini Course 01 — Grief & Loss
**Promise:** Understand grief’s impact on mind, body, and spirit, and take first steps toward Christ-centered comfort and stabilization.

**Audience Pain Points:** Loss of a child/parent/spouse, miscarriage, divorce, business collapse, foreclosure, illness-driven losses, estrangement.

**Distress Pattern (Clinical):**
- Acute grief → waves of sadness, yearning, sleep disruption, low appetite.
- Complicated grief → prolonged functional impairment, guilt, rumination.
- Nervous system → hyperarousal (anxiety) or hypoarousal (numbness); impaired working memory and decision fatigue.

**Biblical Framework (NLV):**
- **Psalm 34:18** — The Lord is close to the brokenhearted.
- **Matthew 5:4** — Those who have sorrow are happy, for they will be comforted.
- **1 Thessalonians 4:13–14** — Grieve with hope in Christ.

## Teaching Summary (Clinical + Spiritual + Practical) ~450–600 words
Grief is a natural response to meaningful loss. Clinically, early grief commonly brings sleep disturbance, low appetite, difficulty concentrating, and intense emotional waves. When avoidance or rumination dominates for months, grief can become complicated: life shrinks around the loss, guilt hardens, and the nervous system stays dysregulated. Spiritually, Scripture validates grief (Jesus wept; the Psalms lament), yet also offers a path forward: comfort, meaning, and hope that does not deny pain.

A Christ-centered approach holds both truths: (1) sorrow is real and worthy of care; (2) God draws near in it and shepherds us through. The aim is not to erase memories or “move on,” but to integrate loss into a life that still holds love, purpose, and connection. Practical steps focus on stabilizing the body (breath, sleep hygiene), bringing feelings to God in honest prayer, sharing lament in safe community, and taking small acts of re-engagement with daily life.

Clinically, naming triggers reduces fear of them. Spiritually, naming grief before God is worshipful honesty. Together they decrease avoidance, restore regulation, and open room for meaning-making: honoring the one or the thing lost while re-entering life with Christ.

God does not rush your grief. He meets you *in* it. The cross shows love that suffers with us; the resurrection secures hope beyond loss. Today, let your tears be prayers. Your lament is not faithlessness; it is faith in a God who listens.

## Narration Script (Video)
**Hook:**  
Grief changes everything. Not just our feelings, but our sleep, focus, and even the size of our world. If loss has left you numb, overwhelmed, or stuck, this short session is your first, gentle step forward.

**Teach (clinical + spiritual):**  
When we lose someone or something precious, our nervous system goes on high alert or shuts down. That is not weakness; it’s the body’s alarm saying, “You mattered to me.” Avoiding the pain often makes it louder. Bringing sorrow into safe space—before God and a trusted person—helps the body settle and the heart breathe again. The Bible never shames lament. It says, “The Lord is close to the brokenhearted” (Psalm 34:18, NLV). Jesus wept. And yet, Scripture also anchors us: “Those who have sorrow are happy, for they will be comforted” (Matthew 5:4, NLV). We grieve honestly, and we grieve with hope.

**Practice:**  
Join me for a brief regulation exercise. Inhale for four, hold for two, exhale for six… five rounds. Notice three sensations in your body, three things you see, three sounds you hear. Now pray: “Lord, be near to my broken heart today.” Let a single tear be a whole prayer.

**Next step:**  
Take one small re-engagement action: drink water, message a friend, step outside, or open your Bible to Psalm 34. Healing is a series of small, faithful steps.
