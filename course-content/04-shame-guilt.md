# Mini Course 04 — Shame & Guilt
**Promise:** Disarm toxic shame and unresolved guilt with Christ-centered truth and compassionate practice so you can move forward in freedom.

**Distress Pattern (Clinical):**
- Shame = “I am bad” (global self-condemnation, hiding, isolation).
- Guilt = “I did wrong” (behavior-focused; can lead to repair).
- Loops: perfectionism, rumination, self-punishment, withdrawal.

**Biblical Framework (NLV):**
- **Romans 8:1** — “There is no guilt to be punished for those who are in Christ Jesus.”
- **1 John 1:9** — Confess → He forgives and makes us clean.
- **Psalm 32:5** — “You forgave the wrong I did.”
- **Isaiah 54:4** — “Do not be afraid; you will not be put to shame.”

## Teaching Summary (Clinical + Spiritual + Practical) ~450–600 words
Shame tells a global story: *“I am unworthy and beyond repair.”* Guilt tells a specific story: *“I did wrong.”* The first collapses identity; the second invites change. Clinically, shame narrows life—people hide, people-please, or overperform to outrun exposure. Spiritually, the gospel separates *who you are in Christ* from *what you’ve done*. In Jesus, condemnation was nailed to the cross; confession is now a doorway to cleansing, not a courtroom for sentencing.

We pair **compassionate awareness** (naming shame messages) with **truth replacement** (Romans 8:1) and **repair actions** where appropriate (apology, restitution, boundary reset). The nervous system softens when we shift from attack to care; the soul steadies when Scripture re-anchors identity. Over time, practicing confession + compassion + correction forms a new loop: humility, clean conscience, and quiet confidence before God and people.

## Practical Application (2 Tools)
**Tool 1 — “Name & Replace” (5 minutes)**
- Write the shame sentence: “Because ___, I am ___.”
- Replace with Scripture: “In Christ, I am **forgiven and made clean** (1 John 1:9, NLV). There is **no condemnation** (Romans 8:1, NLV).”
- Breathe 4-2-6 × 4 rounds while reading the truth aloud.

**Tool 2 — Repair Plan (10 minutes)**
- If guilt is valid, list: person(s) affected, one apology line, one restitution step.
- Pray Psalm 32:5 (NLV), then do the *next right step* within 24 hours.

## Short Devotional (2–3 minutes)
Jesus did not come to expose you to scorn but to cover you with grace. He lifts your head. Confession is not self-hatred; it is agreement with God’s love and truth. Today, trade the heavy cloak of shame for His robe of righteousness.

---

## Scriptures for Meditation (NLV)
- Romans 8:1; 1 John 1:9; Psalm 32:5; Isaiah 54:4; Hebrews 12:2.

## Narration Script (Video)
**Hook:**  
If your inner critic never rests, this is for you.

**Teach:**  
Shame attacks identity; guilt addresses behavior. In Christ, there is no condemnation (Romans 8:1, NLV). Confession cleanses (1 John 1:9, NLV). Practically, we name the shame sentence and replace it with truth; when we’ve wronged someone, we repair instead of ruminating.

**Practice:**  
Write the sentence. Read Romans 8:1 aloud while breathing 4-2-6. Start your Repair Plan and schedule one step in the next 24 hours.
