## Medium Caption (Instagram / Facebook)

High-functioning on the outside. Torn on the inside.

Many of God's children are silently battling **{{ROOT_CAUSE}}**, thinking it's just a personality flaw or "the way things are."

In *{{COURSE_TITLE}}*, we'll walk through:
• What this really is emotionally + spiritually
• How trauma and spiritual warfare feed it
• A gentle, faith-based step you can take today

## Long Caption (LinkedIn / FB Groups / Email)

You can be the "strong one," the responsible one, the one everyone leans on…
and still be quietly drowning under **{{ROOT_CAUSE}}**.

This isn't about being weak or not having "enough faith."
This is about trauma, spiritual warfare, and a nervous system that has been in survival for too long.

In *{{COURSE_TITLE}}*, we cover:

• The hidden pattern behind {{ROOT_CAUSE}}
• How it shows up in your thoughts, body, and finances
• How the enemy uses it to distort your identity
• A faith-based, trauma-aware way to begin healing

You are not alone in this. And you are not an accident in God's story.
