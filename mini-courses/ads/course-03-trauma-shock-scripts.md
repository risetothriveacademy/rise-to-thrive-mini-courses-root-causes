## 2. LONG AD (60-90 seconds)

**Title:** "Your Body Remembers What Your Mind Tries to Forget"

**Hook (0-10s):**
"After trauma, do you feel like part of you is stuck in that moment? Like you can't fully be present? You're not broken—you're experiencing trauma response."

**Story/Qualify (10-30s):**
Trauma isn't just what happened to you—it's what happened inside you when you couldn't escape, fight back, or process what was happening.

Your body went into freeze mode to survive. And sometimes, it stays there—even when the danger is gone.

**Teaching (30-60s):**
This course teaches you:
- How trauma gets stored in your body (polyvagal theory simplified)
- Somatic tools to release trapped stress
- Biblical lament for processing trauma with God
- How to differentiate between flashbacks and present reality

This isn't about reliving the trauma. It's about helping your body know it's over.

**Authority/Proof (60-75s):**
Created by Torah Mathews, trauma-informed coach who has walked through life-altering trauma and found healing through faith and science.

## 3. YOUTUBE LONG-FORM (8-12 minutes)

**Title:** "What Trauma Really Does to Your Body & How God Heals | Trauma-Informed Faith"

**Hook (0-30s):**
If you've experienced trauma—abuse, assault, a car accident, sudden loss, betrayal—you know that "just move on" doesn't work.

Your body remembers. Your nervous system stays on high alert. And sometimes, you feel disconnected from yourself, from others, from God.

Today I want to explain what trauma actually does to your body, and how God meets you in it.

**Intro/Qualify (30s-1:30):**
I'm Torah Mathews, and I've experienced trauma that shattered my sense of safety. For a long time, I thought I just needed to pray harder or have more faith.

But trauma isn't a spiritual failure. It's a physiological response. And God has given us tools for both our souls and our bodies.

**Section 1: Understanding Trauma (Clinical) (1:30-4:00):**

When something overwhelming happens—especially when you can't escape—your nervous system does three things:

1. **Fight:** You try to stop it
2. **Flight:** You try to run
3. **Freeze:** When you can't fight or flee, you shut down

That freeze response is your body's last-resort survival mechanism. It's why people who experience trauma sometimes:
- Can't remember details
- Feel numb or disconnected
- Have physical symptoms (pain, digestive issues, fatigue)
- Struggle to feel safe even when they are safe

This is called **trauma encoding**—your body stored the experience as "unfinished threat."

And until your nervous system processes it, part of you stays stuck there.

**Section 2: The Biblical Framework (4:00-6:30):**

Here's the good news: God is not distant from your trauma.

**Psalm 147:3 (NLV):** "He heals the broken-hearted and binds up their wounds."

**Psalm 23:4 (NLV):** "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will not be afraid of anything, because You are with me."

God doesn't minimize trauma. He walks with you through the valley.

And notice—He **binds wounds**. That's active healing, not just spiritual bypassing.

**Section 3: Practical Tools (6:30-9:30):**

**Tool 1: Grounding Exercise (5-4-3-2-1)**
When you feel triggered or disconnected:
1. Name 5 things you can see
2. 4 things you can touch
3. 3 things you can hear
4. 2 things you can smell
5. 1 thing you can taste

This brings your brain back to the present moment.

**Tool 2: Body Scan Prayer**
Lie down. Starting at your head, slowly scan your body:
- "God, I invite Your peace into my head, my neck, my shoulders..."
- Notice where you feel tension
- Breathe into that space and invite God's presence there

This is biblical mindfulness—bringing God's presence into your physical experience.

**Section 4: Next Steps (9:30-11:00):**
