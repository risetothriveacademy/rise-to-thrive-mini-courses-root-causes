## 3. YOUTUBE LONG-FORM (8-12 minutes)

**Title:** "The Body-Mind-Spirit Connection Christians Miss | Physical Roots of Mental Health"

**Hook (0-30s):**
If you're a Christian struggling with mental health, you've probably been told:
- "Pray more."
- "Have more faith."
- "It's spiritual warfare."

And while those can be true, sometimes the root cause is **biological**—and God gave us medicine, doctors, and science to steward our bodies well.

**Intro/Qualify (30s-1:30):**
I'm Torah Mathews, and for years I battled depression and anxiety. I prayed. I fasted. I went to deliverance.

And nothing changed.

Until I got my blood work done and discovered **my thyroid wasn't functioning, my cortisol was through the roof, and my gut was inflamed.**

**Section 1: Understanding Biological Factors (Clinical) (1:30-4:00):**

Your mental health is affected by:

**1. Hormones:**
- Thyroid dysfunction → depression, fatigue
- Cortisol dysregulation → anxiety, insomnia
- Estrogen/testosterone imbalance → mood swings

**2. Inflammation:**
- Chronic inflammation → brain fog, depression
- Autoimmune conditions → fatigue, anxiety

**3. Gut Health:**
- 90% of serotonin is made in your gut
- Gut dysbiosis → mood disorders

**4. Nutritional Deficiencies:**
- Vitamin D, B12, magnesium, omega-3 deficiencies → depression, anxiety

**Sometimes "pray more" isn't the answer. "Get your thyroid checked" is.**

**Section 2: The Biblical Framework (4:00-6:30):**

**1 Corinthians 6:19-20 (NLV):** "Do you not know that your body is a house of God where the Holy Spirit lives?... So honor God with your body."

**3 John 1:2 (NLV):** "I pray that you are doing well in every way. I pray that your body is strong and well even as your soul is strong and well."

God cares about your **physical health**—not just your spiritual health.

Seeking medical help isn't a lack of faith. **It's stewardship.**

**Section 3: Practical Tools (6:30-9:30):**

**Tool 1: Get the Right Labs**
Ask your doctor to test:
- Thyroid panel (TSH, Free T3, Free T4)
- Cortisol (morning and evening)
- Vitamin D, B12, iron, magnesium
- Inflammatory markers (CRP)

**Tool 2: Support Your Body**
- Eat anti-inflammatory foods
- Prioritize sleep
- Move your body gently
- Reduce sugar and processed foods

**Tool 3: Integrate Faith & Medicine**
Pray: **"God, help me steward my body well. Show me what needs healing—spiritually, emotionally, and physically."**

**Section 4: Next Steps (9:30-11:00):**
