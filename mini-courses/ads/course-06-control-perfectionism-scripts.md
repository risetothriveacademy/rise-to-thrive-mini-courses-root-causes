## 2. LONG AD (60-90 seconds)

**Title:** "What If You Didn't Have to Control Everything?"

**Hook (0-10s):**
"Are you exhausted from trying to manage every detail? What if I told you that your need for control is actually fear in disguise?"

**Story/Qualify (10-30s):**
Perfectionism isn't about excellence. It's about safety.

Somewhere along the way, you learned: "If I control everything, I won't get hurt." So you:
- Over-prepare
- Over-function
- Can't delegate
- Can't rest

And it's exhausting.

**Teaching (30-60s):**
This course teaches you:
- The trauma roots of perfectionism
- How control creates anxiety (not peace)
- The difference between healthy standards and perfectionism
- How to surrender control to God (practically, not just spiritually)

You'll learn to distinguish between what's yours to manage and what's God's to hold.

**Authority/Proof (60-75s):**
Created by Torah Mathews, recovering perfectionist who has learned to rest in God's sovereignty.

## 3. YOUTUBE LONG-FORM (8-12 minutes)

**Title:** "The Truth About Perfectionism & Control | Why You Can't Rest & How to Surrender"

**Hook (0-30s):**
If you're a high-achiever, a planner, a doer—you probably think your perfectionism is what makes you successful.

But what if it's actually keeping you anxious, exhausted, and unable to experience God's peace?

**Intro/Qualify (30s-1:30):**
I'm Torah Mathews, and I was the "get it done" person. The one who planned every detail, anticipated every problem, and couldn't delegate because "no one would do it right."

I thought that was strength. But it was actually fear.

**Section 1: Understanding Control & Perfectionism (Clinical) (1:30-4:00):**

Perfectionism is a **trauma response**.

When you experienced chaos, abuse, or unpredictability as a child, your brain learned: **"If I control everything, I'll be safe."**

So you developed:
- High standards (to avoid criticism)
- Over-functioning (to avoid disappointing others)
- Rigid routines (to create predictability)
- Difficulty delegating (to avoid vulnerability)

But here's the problem: **Control creates anxiety, not peace.**

The more you try to control, the more anxious you become—because you can't control everything.

**Section 2: The Biblical Framework (4:00-6:30):**

**Psalm 46:10 (NLV):** "Be still and know that I am God."

**Proverbs 3:5-6 (NLV):** "Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not trust in your own understanding. Agree with Him in all your ways, and He will make your paths straight."

**Matthew 6:34 (NLV):** "Do not worry about tomorrow. Tomorrow will have its own worries."

God doesn't call you to control everything. He calls you to **trust Him with everything.**

**Section 3: Practical Tools (6:30-9:30):**

**Tool 1: The Control Audit**
Make two lists:
1. Things I can control (my thoughts, my actions, my responses)
2. Things I can't control (other people, outcomes, the future)

Practice releasing list #2 in prayer: **"God, this is Yours. I trust You with it."**

**Tool 2: Practice Imperfection**
Intentionally do something imperfectly:
- Send an email without triple-checking
- Leave dishes in the sink
- Say no to a responsibility

Notice the discomfort. Breathe through it. Let God be God.

**Section 4: Next Steps (9:30-11:00):**

I've created a full mini course called "Control & Perfectionism" that includes:
- Deep teaching on the roots of perfectionism
- Worksheets to identify what you're really trying to control
- Scripture meditation for surrendering
- A 7-day letting-go challenge

Normally $99, now $49.
