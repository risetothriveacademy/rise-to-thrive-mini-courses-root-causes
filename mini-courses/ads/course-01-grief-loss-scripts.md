## 2. LONG AD (60-90 seconds)

**Title:** "God Doesn't Rush Your Grief"

**Hook (0-10s):**
"Are you stuck in grief that feels like it's never going to end? You're not alone, and there is hope."

**Story/Qualify (10-30s):**
When you lose someone or something meaningful—a loved one, a marriage, a dream, your health—the pain doesn't follow a timeline. Your body goes into survival mode. Your mind replays memories. And people around you expect you to 'move on.'

But God doesn't rush your grief. He meets you in it.

**Teaching (30-60s):**
Grief is both a clinical reality and a spiritual journey. Your nervous system needs tools to calm the waves of panic and sadness. Your soul needs permission to lament honestly before God—like David, like Job, like Jesus at Lazarus' tomb.

This mini course teaches you:
- 5-minute grounding techniques to calm your body
- Biblical lament prayers to process pain with God
- One next step you can actually take today

**Authority/Proof (60-75s):**
Developed by Torah Mathews, trauma-informed coach and believer who has walked through devastating loss. This isn't theory—it's tested truth.

**CTA (75-90s):**

## 3. YOUTUBE LONG-FORM (8-12 minutes)

**Title:** "How to Process Grief Without Losing Your Faith | Biblical + Clinical Tools for Healing"

**Hook (0-30s):**
If you're watching this, you've likely experienced a loss that has shaken you to your core. Maybe you lost a loved one, went through a devastating divorce, lost your business, or experienced a trauma that changed everything.

Today I want to talk about grief—not just as an emotion, but as a full-body, mind, and spirit experience. And I want to show you how God meets you in grief, not to rush you through it, but to walk with you through it.

**Intro/Qualify (30s-1:30):**
I'm Torah Mathews, and I've walked through loss that I never thought I'd survive. I lost my business, my home, my savings, my health—and most painfully, the life I thought I was building.

What I learned in that season is that grief is both a clinical reality and a sacred journey. Your body, your mind, and your soul all need specific care. And the good news is: God has given us tools for all three.

**Section 1: Understanding Grief (Clinical) (1:30-4:00):**

When you experience significant loss, your nervous system goes into survival mode. This is why you might feel:
- Waves of intense sadness that come out of nowhere
- Trouble sleeping or eating
- Brain fog and difficulty making decisions
- Numbness or feeling disconnected from reality

This isn't weakness—this is your body trying to protect you from overwhelming pain.

The clinical term is "acute grief response," and in some cases, it can develop into "complicated grief" where the pain becomes so consuming that daily functioning feels impossible.

Your brain is literally rewiring. The person or thing you lost was part of your neural pathways—your daily routines, your sense of safety, your identity. And now those pathways are disrupted.

**Section 2: The Biblical Framework (4:00-6:30):**

Here's what's beautiful: God doesn't minimize this. He doesn't tell you to "just have more faith" or "get over it."

Look at these Scriptures:
- **Psalm 34:18 (NLV):** "The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit."
- **Matthew 5:4 (NLV):** "Those who have sorrow are happy, for they will be comforted."
- **John 11:35:** Jesus wept at Lazarus' tomb—even though He was about to raise him from the dead!

God gives you permission to grieve. The Psalms are full of lament—honest, raw prayers where people cry out to God in pain, confusion, even anger.

Grief isn't a lack of faith. It's evidence that you loved deeply. And God honors that.

**Section 3: Practical Tools (6:30-9:30):**

So what do you do when the waves hit? Let me give you two practical tools:

**Tool 1: 5-Minute Ground & Breathe**
When panic or sadness overwhelms you:
1. Place both feet flat on the floor
2. Breathe in for 4 counts, hold for 4, out for 6
3. Repeat 5 times
4. Say out loud: "God is with me in this moment"

This activates your parasympathetic nervous system—the part that calms you down.

**Tool 2: Guided Lament (10 minutes)**
Write or speak this prayer structure:
1. "God, I'm struggling with..." (be honest)
2. "I need You to..." (ask specifically)
3. "I choose to trust that..." (anchor in truth)
4. "Thank You for..." (even one small thing)

This is biblical lament. It lets you be real with God while anchoring your soul in His character.

**Section 4: Next Steps (9:30-11:00):**

If this resonates with you, I want to invite you to go deeper. I've created a full 1-day mini course called "Grief & Loss" that includes:
- A complete teaching video (9-12 minutes)
- Downloadable worksheets with these tools
- Scripture meditation guide
- A gentle action plan for your next 7 days

It's designed for busy people who need real help, not just inspiration.

The course is normally $99, but right now you can access it for $49.

And here's why I created this: Because when I was in the pit of grief, I didn't need someone to tell me to "be strong." I needed someone to say, "God is with you right here, and here's how to take the next breath."
