## 2. LONG AD (60-90 seconds)

**Title:** "The Difference Between Shame and Conviction"

**Hook (0-10s):**
"Do you feel like you're never good enough? Like God is disappointed in you? That's shame—and it's not from God."

**Story/Qualify (10-30s):**
Shame says: "I am bad."
Guilt says: "I did something bad."
Conviction says: "God is calling me to something better."

Most Christians confuse shame with conviction. They think the crushing, condemning voice is the Holy Spirit. But that's not how God speaks.

**Teaching (30-60s):**
This course teaches you:
- How shame gets encoded in childhood and trauma
- The neurological difference between shame and healthy conviction
- How to identify and silence shame-based thoughts
- Biblical truths that rewire your identity

You'll learn to distinguish God's voice (loving, specific, hopeful) from the enemy's voice (condemning, vague, hopeless).

**Authority/Proof (60-75s):**
Created by Torah Mathews, who has battled shame and walked into freedom through Christ-centered healing.

**CTA (75-90s):**

## 3. YOUTUBE LONG-FORM (8-12 minutes)

**Title:** "How to Break Free From Shame & Walk in God's Acceptance | Biblical Freedom"

**Hook (0-30s):**
If you grew up in a shaming environment, experienced abuse, or made mistakes that you can't forgive yourself for, you know what shame feels like.

It's that voice that says:
- "You're too broken."
- "You'll never change."
- "God could never use you."

But what if I told you that voice isn't from God? And there's a way to silence it.

**Intro/Qualify (30s-1:30):**
I'm Torah Mathews, and shame was my constant companion for years. Even as a Christian, I felt like I was too damaged for God to fully love.

Until I learned the difference between **shame and conviction**—and how God sees me.

**Section 1: Understanding Shame (Clinical) (1:30-4:00):**

Shame is different from guilt:
- **Guilt:** "I made a mistake."
- **Shame:** "I am a mistake."

Shame gets wired into your brain through:
- Childhood messages ("You're too much," "You're not enough")
- Trauma or abuse
- Perfectionism and comparison
- Religious environments that emphasize rules over relationship

When shame takes root, it creates:
- Chronic feelings of unworthiness
- Hiding and isolation
- Self-sabotage
- Inability to receive love

**Section 2: The Biblical Framework (4:00-6:30):**

**Romans 8:1 (NLV):** "So now, those who belong to Christ will not suffer the punishment of sin."

**Psalm 103:12 (NLV):** "He has taken our sins from us as far as the east is from the west."

**1 John 3:1 (NLV):** "See what great love the Father has for us that He would call us His children. And this is what we are."

God doesn't shame you. He convicts you to lead you to life.

Shame says: "Hide."
Conviction says: "Come home."

**Section 3: Practical Tools (6:30-9:30):**

**Tool 1: Shame vs. Conviction Test**
When you hear a condemning thought, ask:
- Is it specific or vague? (God is specific)
- Does it lead to hope or despair? (God leads to hope)
- Does it draw me closer to God or push me away? (God draws you in)

**Tool 2: Identity Declaration**
When shame attacks, speak truth out loud:
- "I am a child of God." (1 John 3:1)
- "I am deeply loved." (Ephesians 2:4-5)
- "I am being transformed." (2 Corinthians 3:18)

This rewires shame-based neural pathways.

**Section 4: Next Steps (9:30-11:00):**

- Deep teaching on breaking shame cycles
- Downloadable identity declarations
- Scripture meditation for healing
