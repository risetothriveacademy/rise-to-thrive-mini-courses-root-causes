## 2. LONG AD (60-90 seconds)

**Title:** "God Sees Your Financial Crisis"

**Hook (0-10s):**
"Have you lost your income? Your business? Your savings? Are you wondering where God is in your financial crisis?"

**Story/Qualify (10-30s):**
Financial distress isn't just about money. It's about:
- Safety (How will I survive?)
- Identity (I'm a failure)
- Shame (I should have done better)
- Fear (What if it never gets better?)

Your nervous system goes into survival mode. And it's hard to think, plan, or hear God clearly.

**Teaching (30-60s):**
This course teaches you:
- How financial trauma affects your nervous system
- Biblical stewardship in crisis
- Tools to calm financial anxiety
- How to make decisions when you're in panic mode

You'll learn to separate the facts from the fear, and trust God's provision one day at a time.

**Authority/Proof (60-75s):**
Created by Torah Mathews, who lost her business, home, and savings—and walked through financial devastation with God.

## 3. YOUTUBE LONG-FORM (8-12 minutes)

**Title:** "How to Trust God in Financial Crisis | Biblical Wisdom + Practical Tools"

**Hook (0-30s):**
If you're facing financial loss right now—job loss, business failure, medical bills, foreclosure—you know the fear that comes with it.

It's not just about money. It's about survival. Safety. Your future.

Today I want to talk about how to navigate financial crisis with faith and practical wisdom.

**Intro/Qualify (30s-1:30):**
I'm Torah Mathews, and I lost everything financially. My business. My home. My savings. My investment properties.

And in that season, I learned that **God's provision doesn't always look like abundance. Sometimes it looks like manna—just enough for today.**

**Section 1: Understanding Financial Trauma (Clinical) (1:30-4:00):**

When you experience financial loss, your brain enters **survival mode**:
- Your amygdala (fear center) takes over
- Your prefrontal cortex (decision-making) goes offline
- You feel panic, shame, and paralysis

This is why financial stress causes:
- Sleep problems
- Digestive issues
- Inability to focus
- Relationship conflict
- Feeling like you can't breathe

**You're not weak. Your nervous system is responding to a legitimate threat.**

**Section 2: The Biblical Framework (4:00-6:30):**

**Philippians 4:19 (NLV):** "My God will give you everything you need because of His great riches in Christ Jesus."

**Matthew 6:25-34 (NLV):** "Do not worry about your life... Look at the birds... your Father in heaven feeds them... Are you not more important than the birds?"

**Psalm 37:25 (NLV):** "I have been young, and now I am old. Yet I have not seen the one who is right with God left alone, or his children begging for bread."

God doesn't promise wealth. He promises **provision**.

And provision doesn't mean excess. It means **enough for today.**

**Section 3: Practical Tools (6:30-9:30):**

**Tool 1: Facts vs. Fear**
Write two columns:
1. **Facts:** What is actually true right now?
2. **Fear:** What am I afraid might happen?

This helps your brain separate reality from catastrophizing.

**Tool 2: One-Day Stewardship**
Instead of trying to solve everything:
1. Ask: "What do I need today?"
2. Take one small action (call one creditor, apply for one job, etc.)
3. Thank God for one provision today

This keeps you out of panic and in present-moment faith.

**Section 4: Next Steps (9:30-11:00):**

I've created a full mini course called "Financial Distress" that includes:
- Deeper teaching on financial trauma
- Worksheets for budgeting in crisis
- Scripture meditation for provision
- A 7-day action plan for moving forward

Normally $99, now $49.
