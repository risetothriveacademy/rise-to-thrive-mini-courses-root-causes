- How rejection wounds create attachment patterns

## 3. YOUTUBE LONG-FORM (8-12 minutes)

**Title:** "How to Heal From Rejection & Stop Pushing People Away | Attachment & Faith"

**Hook (0-30s):**
If you've been rejected—by a parent, a spouse, a friend, a community—you know it leaves a mark.

Not just emotional pain, but deep beliefs like:
- "I'm not worthy of love."
- "People always leave."
- "I have to earn belonging."

Today I want to show you how rejection wounds work, and how God heals them.

**Intro/Qualify (30s-1:30):**
I'm Torah Mathews, and I've been abandoned by people I thought would never leave. And for years, I recreated that pattern—pushing people away before they could hurt me, or clinging so tightly I suffocated them.

Until I learned about **attachment wounds** and how God designed us for connection.

**Section 1: Understanding Rejection (Clinical) (1:30-4:00):**

Rejection creates an **attachment wound**:
- Secure attachment: "I'm safe to be myself."
- Anxious attachment: "I'm afraid you'll leave, so I cling."
- Avoidant attachment: "I don't need anyone."
- Disorganized attachment: "I want closeness but I push it away."

These patterns form early (usually in childhood) and replay in adult relationships.

If you were rejected, your nervous system learned: **"I'm unsafe when I'm myself."**

So you adapt:
- You hide parts of yourself
- You over-perform to earn love
- You push people away first
- You self-sabotage relationships

**Section 2: The Biblical Framework (4:00-6:30):**

**Hebrews 13:5 (NLV):** "I will never leave you or let you be alone."

**Isaiah 49:15-16 (NLV):** "Can a woman forget her nursing child? ... Even these may forget, but I will not forget you. See, I have marked you on My hands."

**Romans 8:38-39 (NLV):** "...nothing can separate us from the love of God."

God is the **secure attachment** you've been looking for.

He doesn't reject you. He doesn't abandon you. He doesn't need you to perform.

**Section 3: Practical Tools (6:30-9:30):**

**Tool 1: Core Belief Audit**
Write down your automatic thoughts about relationships:
- "People always leave."
- "I'm too much."
- "I have to earn love."

Now replace each one with God's truth:
- "God will never leave me."
- "I am fearfully and wonderfully made."
- "I am loved because I am His child."

**Tool 2: Practicing Secure Attachment**
With one safe person:
1. Share a fear or need
2. Notice your impulse to take it back or push away
3. Stay present
4. Let them respond

This rewires your nervous system for secure connection.

**Section 4: Next Steps (9:30-11:00):**

I've created a full mini course called "Rejection & Abandonment" that includes:
- Deep teaching on attachment wounds
- Worksheets to identify your patterns
- Scripture meditation for healing
