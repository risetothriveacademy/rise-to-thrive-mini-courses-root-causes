### **Description** (5000 character limit)

```
If you're watching this, you've likely experienced a loss that has shaken you to your core. Maybe you lost a loved one, went through a devastating divorce, lost your business, or experienced a trauma that changed everything.

Today I want to talk about grief—not just as an emotion, but as a full-body, mind, and spirit experience. And I want to show you how God meets you in grief, not to rush you through it, but to walk with you through it.

💔 THE CLINICAL REALITY OF GRIEF:

When you experience significant loss, your nervous system goes into survival mode. This is why you might feel:
- Waves of intense sadness that come out of nowhere
- Trouble sleeping or eating
- Brain fog and difficulty making decisions
- Numbness or feeling disconnected from reality

This isn't weakness—this is your body trying to protect you from overwhelming pain.

✝️ BIBLICAL PERMISSION TO GRIEVE:

God doesn't minimize this. He doesn't tell you to "just have more faith."

**Psalm 34:18:** "The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit."
**Matthew 5:4:** "Those who have sorrow are happy, for they will be comforted."
**John 11:35:** Jesus wept at Lazarus' tomb!

Grief isn't a lack of faith. It's evidence that you loved deeply.
