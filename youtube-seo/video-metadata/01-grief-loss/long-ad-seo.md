### **Description** (5000 character limit)

```
Are you stuck in grief that feels like it's never going to end? You're not alone—and there is hope.

😢 IF THIS IS YOU:
→ You lost someone or something meaningful (loved one, marriage, dream, health)
→ The pain doesn't follow a timeline
→ Your body is stuck in survival mode
→ People expect you to "move on" but you can't
→ Prayer alone hasn't healed the depth of your pain

✝️ GOD MEETS YOU IN GRIEF:
"The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit." - Psalm 34:18

God doesn't rush your grief. He walks with you through it.
